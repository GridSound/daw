[__*GridSound*__(.com)](http://gridsound.com) is a (**work-in-progress**) free open-source HTML5 audio sequencer based on the new fresh WebAudio technology. We are also creating a [__*webaudio-library*__](https://github.com/GridSound/webaudio-library) to extract the reusable audio stuff code. If you're interesting, we're inviting you to read the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/GridSound/daw/wiki) to have more infos (like: *todolist*, *how to contribute*, *assets*, etc.).

Please, enjoy ! :smile:
